# Gets a SingleCellExperiment from curated metadata

Given a data frame of Curated Atlas metadata obtained from
[`get_metadata()`](https://mangiolalaboratory.github.io/cellNexus/reference/get_metadata.md),
returns a
[`SingleCellExperiment::SingleCellExperiment`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/SingleCellExperiment/man/SingleCellExperiment.html)
object corresponding to the samples in that data frame

## Usage

``` r
get_SingleCellExperiment(...)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  Arguments passed on to
  [`get_single_cell_experiment`](https://mangiolalaboratory.github.io/cellNexus/reference/get_single_cell_experiment.md)

  `data`

  :   A data frame containing, at minimum, `cell_id`,
      `file_id_cellNexus_single_cell` and `atlas_id` columns, which
      correspond to a single cell ID, file subdivision for internal use,
      and atlas name in format (e.g cellxgene/06-02-2025) for internal
      use. They can be obtained from the
      [`get_metadata()`](https://mangiolalaboratory.github.io/cellNexus/reference/get_metadata.md)
      function.

  `assays`

  :   A character vector specifying the desired assay(s) to be
      requested. Valid elements include "counts", "cpm", "rank", and
      "sct" for single-cell analyses The default setting retrieves only
      the counts assay. If your analysis involves a smaller set of
      genes, consider using the "cpm" assay. The "rank" assay is suited
      for signature calculations across millions of cells.

  `cell_aggregation`

  :   A character vector that specifies which cell aggregation strategy
      should be applied. This will create a corresponding subdirectory
      in the cache directory. Single cell level is applied by default.

  `cache_directory`

  :   An optional character vector of length one. If provided, it should
      indicate a local file path where any remotely accessed files
      should be copied.

  `repository`

  :   A character vector of length one. If provided, it should be an
      HTTP URL pointing to the location where the single cell data is
      stored.

  `features`

  :   An optional character vector of features (ie genes) to return the
      counts for. By default counts for all features will be returned.
      When provided, the returned object will contain exactly the
      requested features (row order preserved), and any
      experiments/samples that do not contain all requested features are
      dropped. This preserves the full set of requested features at the
      cost of potentially fewer samples. A warning is emitted when
      samples are dropped.

## Value

A `SingleCellExperiment` object.
