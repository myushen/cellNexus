# Gets a SingleCellExperiment from curated metadata

Given a data frame of Curated Atlas metadata obtained from
[`get_metadata()`](https://mangiolalaboratory.github.io/cellNexus/reference/get_metadata.md),
returns a
[`SingleCellExperiment::SingleCellExperiment`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/SingleCellExperiment/man/SingleCellExperiment.html)
object corresponding to the samples in that data frame

## Usage

``` r
get_single_cell_experiment(
  data,
  assays = "counts",
  cell_aggregation = "",
  cache_directory = get_default_cache_dir(),
  repository = COUNTS_URL,
  features = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data frame containing, at minimum, `cell_id`,
  `file_id_cellNexus_single_cell` and `atlas_id` columns, which
  correspond to a single cell ID, file subdivision for internal use, and
  atlas name in format (e.g cellxgene/06-02-2025) for internal use. They
  can be obtained from the
  [`get_metadata()`](https://mangiolalaboratory.github.io/cellNexus/reference/get_metadata.md)
  function.

- assays:

  A character vector specifying the desired assay(s) to be requested.
  Valid elements include "counts", "cpm", "rank", and "sct" for
  single-cell analyses The default setting retrieves only the counts
  assay. If your analysis involves a smaller set of genes, consider
  using the "cpm" assay. The "rank" assay is suited for signature
  calculations across millions of cells.

- cell_aggregation:

  A character vector that specifies which cell aggregation strategy
  should be applied. This will create a corresponding subdirectory in
  the cache directory. Single cell level is applied by default.

- cache_directory:

  An optional character vector of length one. If provided, it should
  indicate a local file path where any remotely accessed files should be
  copied.

- repository:

  A character vector of length one. If provided, it should be an HTTP
  URL pointing to the location where the single cell data is stored.

- features:

  An optional character vector of features (ie genes) to return the
  counts for. By default counts for all features will be returned. When
  provided, the returned object will contain exactly the requested
  features (row order preserved), and any experiments/samples that do
  not contain all requested features are dropped. This preserves the
  full set of requested features at the cost of potentially fewer
  samples. A warning is emitted when samples are dropped.

## Value

A `SingleCellExperiment` object.
