\title{Create a joined metadata table from parquet files
This function reads metadata parquet files into DuckDB and joins them
into a single lazy table. It is designed to handle split metadata files,
specifically \code{sample_metadata} and \code{cellnexus_cell_metadata}. If both of
these files are present, they will be joined on \code{sample_id} and \code{dataset_id}.
Otherwise, all provided parquet files are read and returned without joining.}
\usage{
create_joined_metadata_table(parquet_files, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{parquet_files}{A character vector of file paths to parquet files.
Expected filenames include \code{"sample_metadata"} and
\code{"cellnexus_cell_metadata"}. If these are not present, the function falls
back to reading all files.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[=read_parquet]{read_parquet()}}.}
}
\value{
A DuckDB-backed lazy table (\code{tbl_dbi}) representing the joined
metadata. This table can be queried with dplyr verbs and evaluated
lazily by DuckDB.
