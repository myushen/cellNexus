\arguments{
\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[=get_single_cell_experiment]{get_single_cell_experiment}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{data}}{A data frame containing, at minimum, \code{cell_id}, \code{file_id_cellNexus_single_cell}
and \code{atlas_id} columns, which correspond to a single cell ID, file subdivision for internal use,
and atlas name in format (e.g cellxgene/06-02-2025) for internal use.
They can be obtained from the \code{\link[=get_metadata]{get_metadata()}} function.}
    \item{\code{assays}}{A character vector specifying the desired assay(s) to be requested.
Valid elements include "counts", "cpm", and "rank" for single-cell analyses, or
"counts" for pseudobulk analyses.
The default setting retrieves only the counts assay.
If your analysis involves a smaller set of genes, consider using the "cpm" assay.
The "rank" assay is suited for signature calculations across millions of cells.}
    \item{\code{cell_aggregation}}{A character vector that specifies which cell aggregation
strategy should be applied. This will create a corresponding subdirectory
in the cache directory. Single cell level is applied by default.}
    \item{\code{cache_directory}}{An optional character vector of length one. If
provided, it should indicate a local file path where any remotely accessed
files should be copied.}
    \item{\code{repository}}{A character vector of length one. If provided, it should be
an HTTP URL pointing to the location where the single cell data is stored.}
    \item{\code{features}}{An optional character vector of features (ie genes) to return
the counts for. By default counts for all features will be returned.
When provided, the returned object will contain exactly the requested
features (row order preserved), and any experiments/samples that do not
contain all requested features are dropped. This preserves the full set
of requested features at the cost of potentially fewer samples.
A warning is emitted when samples are dropped.
